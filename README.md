# Dataset:
I used Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) Dataset. The data collected at baseline include breast ultrasound images among women between 25 and 75 years old. This data was organized in 2018. The number of patients is 600 females, patients. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are in PNG format. The ground truth images are presented with original images. The images are categorized into three classes, which are standard, benign, and malignant.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN and LSTM algorithms.

# Autoencoder layers:

In this layers both Encoder and Decoder are made up of a combination of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) layers, which helps to reduce the size of the input image by recreating it. These layers are CNN layers (Convolutional, Max Pool, Flattening, etc.)
